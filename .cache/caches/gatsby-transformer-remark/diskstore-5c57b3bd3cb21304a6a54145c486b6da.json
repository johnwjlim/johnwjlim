National Park visits in the United States have topped 200 million and social media usage among young Americans is at an all time high. While our public lands are purportedly free and open to all, the sheer remoteness of many of our favorite outdoor locations means that access is often limited to the few who have cars or those who have friends or family who share a similar passion for the outdoors. </p>\n<p>As a group, we each have had experiences where we wanted to explore the outdoors only to find that there was either no means to get there or that there was nobody to go with. Anecdotal evidence from our friends as well as our professor of our rapid prototyping class, Brian Fling, suggested that this problem is not just limited to the seven members within our group but is in fact, potentially part of a larger trend that is prevalent in our society today. </p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/1mwb8avtjcbe/3LI0dc4sBiS0KS0QQCmao6/19df930496355a43723438265f1280b2/shutterstock_779465803.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock 779465803\"></p>\n<p>Test text more test text.
